## Instructions

When cloning this repository you must add the connection to your own SQL Server with the direction you wanna use for this project.

## How it was done

With LOTS of research since there isn't much Visual Basic 6 content to learn from since it's really old. 

## Known Issues

Some parts may still not be fully functional but I'm working to fix them fast!

## Retrospective

| What was done well? | What can I do differently? | What didn't go well? |
------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------
| I'm pretty happy with they way it looks, still can work on the styling further | Having a more clearer idea of how to properly pull all the data from an api will make much easer to work with | some button can break and still need some work to do
